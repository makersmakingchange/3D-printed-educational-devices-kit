### Bottle Opener
This device provides a large gripping surface and clamps onto the caps of standard water bottles with a small squeeze, allowing users to remove or screw on water bottle caps.

### Key Turner
Users loop their finger through the hole and twist to lock and unlock doors with minimal wrist movement. The large key bed can accommodate various shape of key heads.

### Pen Ball
The pen ball makes it easier to grip a pen, pencil, or other writing utensils.

### Palm Pen Holder
Users can gently curl their fingers around a handle to hold it securely or hook their thumb around the writing utensil

### Reading Bar Flat
The dyslexia bar is a tool that isolates text on a page so readers can focus on reading one or two lines at a time. This reading bar can be used on flat documents and sheets of paper.

### Dice Spinner
The switch activated dice spinner utilizes a hobby motor, battery holder, and jack along with a couple 3d printed parts and a clear plastic cup to make any dice game more accessible. It is an easy toy to make that allows children to roll the dice in an alternative way.

### MMC60 Switch
The switch is activated by applying pressure on the top surface. This switch can be connected to any standard AT interface, and can also be used with the Xbox Adaptive Controller. The kit contains different colours and textures of interchangeable button tops.
